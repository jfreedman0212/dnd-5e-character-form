# DND 5e Character Form
A simple Dungeons and Dragons character form, built using Styled Components, Next.js, and React.

This is mostly an exercise in using the new version of React Hook Form (a fantastic library for managing form state) and taking a stab at building a scalable, easy to use design system that imposes good rules while still being flexible enough.
